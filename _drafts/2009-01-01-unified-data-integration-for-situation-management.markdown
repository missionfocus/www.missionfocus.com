*Abstract*

We propose a new solution for data integration and semantic enrichment in support of Situation Management (SIMA). Our solution applies to any modality (e.g. text, images, audio, signals etc.) and embraces the diversity of data sources, types, and models, placing no restrictions on processes, applications, or users. It is database centric and proceeds in stages to address the unified storage of structured data and its semantic enrichment in a way that remains viable in an Ultra-Large Scale systems environment. The result is a layered data integration architecture that can accommodate any kind of data to coherently support the multiplicity of processing required for SIMA.
